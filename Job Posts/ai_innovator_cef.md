# AI Innovator - Build the Future of Verifiable AI

**Location**: Europe/SF  
**Arrangement**: Full-time  
**Team**: CEF.ai (Powered by Cere Network)

---

Are you excited by the opportunity to become a part of a badass team leading the AI-first data revolution?

Do you thrive on solving hard problems (individually and collectively), yet humble and hungry to learn and grow within a team on your path to greatness?

Do you desire to become a part of a close-knit pack led by SV startup veterans who can accelerate your growth 10X (compared to the corporate trajectory/culture)?

If you've answered with 3 resounding "yes", then we want to meet you!

## The Opportunity

We are looking for a hands-on **AI Innovator** who will architect the cognitive layer (CEF) that sits atop our verifiable compute stack (Cere). You'll work at the intersection of Layers 4-7 of our neural architecture—where raw infrastructure becomes intelligent capabilities.

This isn't another "AI wrapper" job. You'll be building:
- **Real-time AI orchestration** that processes millions of events per second
- **Agent runtimes** where AI models execute in cryptographically isolated environments  
- **Verifiable compute pipelines** where every inference has a proof
- **Production systems** already powering autonomous drones (Nightingale) and real-time gaming analytics

We've solved the impossible: making data both private and useful at scale, with AI, in a way that is verifiable. Now we need you to help us turn this foundation into the standard for enterprise AI.

## What You'll Actually Build

### Agent Orchestration Platform (Layer 4)
- Extend ROB (Real-Time Orchestration Builder) to support complex multi-agent workflows
- Design visual interfaces for non-technical users to deploy AI agents in under 60 minutes
- Build hot-swappable model architectures that update without downtime
- Create the "Cubbies" system for secure agent-to-agent communication

### Verifiable AI Runtimes (Layer 5)
- Implement DAC (Data Activity Capture) integration for cryptographic proof of every AI operation
- Design economic models where agents automatically pay for resources and earn from usage
- Build slashing mechanisms that penalize misbehaving agents
- Create real-time dashboards showing agent economics and performance

### Production AI Solutions
- **Computer Vision Pipeline**: Extend our Nightingale drone system that already processes aerial imagery in real-time
- **NLP Sentiment Analysis**: Build on our gaming use case analyzing player communications at scale
- **Personal Health LLMs**: Design privacy-preserving AI that processes medical data without exposing it
- **Trading Agents**: Create verifiable market analysis tools where every prediction has an audit trail

### Infrastructure Innovation
- Architect secure ETL pipelines within DDC (Decentralized Data Clusters)
- Build dynamic indexing systems using Rafts for sub-second query performance
- Design agent deployment systems that go from code to production in minutes
- Create monitoring solutions for distributed AI workloads

## Technical Requirements

### Must-Haves
- **Proven Builder**: Launched AI solutions from concept to scale with tangible revenue generation
- **Systems Thinking**: Experience with distributed systems serving millions of users
- **Modern AI Stack**: Deep hands-on experience with LLMs, computer vision, embeddings, and RAG architectures
- **Full-Stack Capability**: Can build from infrastructure to UI when needed
- **Speed Obsession**: Ship prototypes in days, not months

### Nice-to-Haves
- Experience with Rust, TypeScript, Kotlin
- Blockchain/cryptography knowledge (we'll teach you what you need)
- Background in real-time systems (Kafka, event streaming)
- Prior startup or founding team experience

## What Makes This Different

### You Own What You Build
- Your agents generate revenue that flows directly to you
- Open-source contributions that build your reputation
- Equity in a protocol, not just a company

### Production from Day One
- No "research phase" - you'll deploy to real users immediately
- Work with actual enterprises, not test data
- Your code processes millions of real transactions

### The Team
- Led by Silicon Valley veterans who've built and exited multiple startups
- Small, elite team where your impact is immediately visible
- Direct access to founders and architectural decisions

### The Tech
- 7-layer verifiable compute stack already in production
- Processing data 7x cheaper than AWS with better performance
- 63 global nodes, 99.9% uptime, 114ms average latency
- Real customers, real revenue, real impact

## Compensation & Benefits

- Competitive salary + significant equity
- $CERE token allocation for network participation
- Revenue sharing from agents you build
- Flexible work arrangements
- Team offsites in epic locations
- Top-tier health benefits
- Learning budget for conferences/courses

## The Application Process

We move fast. If you're a fit, expect:
1. Application review within 48 hours
2. Technical discussion with our architects
3. Pair programming session on a real problem
4. Meet the founders
5. Offer within 7 days of first contact
