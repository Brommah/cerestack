# OpenGov vs. Cere DAO: Quick Reference

## Two Layers of Governance Working Together

### **OpenGov (Protocol Layer)**
**What it is**: Autonomous on-chain governance built into the Cere blockchain  
**Who votes**: CERE token holders (1 token = 1 vote)  
**What it controls**:
- ✅ All protocol parameters (storage pricing, validator rewards, etc.)
- ✅ Runtime upgrades and technical changes
- ✅ On-chain treasury allocations
- ✅ Validator admission/removal
- ✅ Slashing conditions

**Key fact**: No one can override OpenGov decisions - not the DAO, not the founders, not anyone

### **Cere DAO (Legal Layer)**
**What it is**: Swiss Association providing real-world support  
**Who votes**: DAO members (1 member = 1 vote, regardless of tokens)  
**What it handles**:
- 📄 Legal contracts with teams and service providers
- 🏛️ Regulatory compliance and tax matters
- 💼 Traditional business operations
- 🤝 Partnerships and real-world agreements
- 🛡️ Legal protection for validators

**Key fact**: The DAO supports OpenGov decisions but cannot control or override them

## How They Work Together

1. **OpenGov decides** storage should cost $0.01/GB → **DAO ensures** node operators understand tax implications
2. **OpenGov approves** funding for development → **DAO handles** the employment contracts
3. **OpenGov changes** validator requirements → **DAO provides** compliance guidance
4. **OpenGov upgrades** the protocol → **DAO coordinates** communication and migration support

## The Bottom Line

- **OpenGov** = The decentralized brain (autonomous decisions)
- **DAO** = The legal hands (real-world execution)

This separation ensures true decentralization while remaining practical in the traditional world.
