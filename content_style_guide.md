# Cere Network Content Style Guide

*The rules for not sounding like every other blockchain project*

---

## Voice & Tone

### We Are:
- **Direct**: Say what you mean. No corporate fluff.
- **Confident**: We built it. It works. Period.
- **Urgent**: The future doesn't wait. Neither do we.
- **Proof-driven**: Claims require evidence. Always.
- **Builder-focused**: We serve those who ship.

### We Are Not:
- **Hyperbolic**: "Revolutionary" is banned. Show revolution instead.
- **Academic**: This isn't a research paper.
- **Defensive**: We don't argue with competitors. We outbuild them.
- **Vague**: "Coming soon" is forbidden. Give dates or don't mention it.
- **Asking permission**: We're not proposing. We're delivering.

---

## Language Rules

### Power Words (Use Freely)
- Build, Ship, Deploy
- Verify, Prove, Own  
- Revenue, Earnings, Value
- Production, Live, Real
- Sovereignty, Control, Direct

### Banned Words (Never Use)
- Revolutionary, Groundbreaking, Innovative
- Ecosystem (unless specifically about agent ecosystem)
- Synergy, Leverage (as buzzwords)
- Potentially, Possibly, Maybe
- Soon™, Coming Soon, In Development
- Disrupt (we're not disrupting, we're replacing)

### Technical Terms (Use Precisely)
- **OpenGov**: On-chain protocol governance (not DAO governance)
- **DAO**: Swiss Association for legal/operational support
- **DDC**: Decentralized Data Clusters (not "storage")
- **DAC**: Data Activity Capture (not "validation")
- **$CERE**: Always with $ symbol
- **Agent**: AI agent (not bot, not app)

## Content Formulas

### The Proof Formula
```
[Bold claim] + [Specific metric] + [Live proof link] + [CTA]
```

**Example**: "We process data 7x cheaper than AWS. Dragon 1 proves it: $0.01/GB vs AWS's $0.07. See live costs → monitor.cere.network"

### The Builder Hook
```
[Time to build] + [What they built] + [What they earned] + [Their code link]
```

**Example**: "@dev spent 47 minutes building a trading agent. It earned $342 in 2 days. Fork the code → github.com/..."

### The Token Holder Activation
```
[Network metric] + [Token demand created] + [Value implication] + [Track it live]
```

**Example**: "147M operations verified this week. Each one required $CERE. Supply/demand math is simple. Watch it live → dac.cere.network"

---

## Visual Standards

### Screenshots Must Show:
- Real data (not mockups)
- Timestamps (prove it's current)
- Performance metrics (prove it works)
- URLs (so they can verify)

### Diagrams Must:
- Explain in 5 seconds
- Use consistent colors (Cere brand)
- Show data flow, not abstract concepts
- Include actual metrics where possible

### Code Snippets Must:
- Work when copy/pasted
- Include all imports
- Show the simplest case
- Compare to incumbent (AWS/Web2)

---

## Platform-Specific Rules

### Twitter
- First line must hook (question, bold claim, or metric)
- Include proof in every tweet (link, screenshot, or code)
- End with clear action (build, invest, share)
- Use threads for technical explanations
- Quote tweet your own successes

### Discord/Telegram  
- Answer questions with links, not essays
- Celebrate builders publicly
- Share metrics daily
- No private discussions of public info
- Screenshot everything for Twitter

### Blog Posts
- Start with the problem (their pain)
- Show solution in first paragraph
- Code examples by paragraph 3
- Metrics throughout
- CTA in every section

### Email
- Subject lines = benefit, not feature
- First line = what they get
- Prove it in paragraph 2
- One clear action per email
- P.S. always has bonus value

## Common Scenarios

### Announcing Features
❌ "We're excited to announce our new feature..."
✅ "Deploy agents 3x faster. New SDK update live. Upgrade: npm update @cere/sdk"

### Competitive Comparisons
❌ "Unlike [competitor], we actually work..."
✅ "Cere: 147M operations yesterday. [Competitor]: Still in testnet. You choose."

### Technical Explanations
❌ "Our innovative consensus mechanism leverages..."
✅ "Every operation gets verified by 20+ validators. Takes 100ms. Costs $0.001. Here's how: [code]"

### Community Building
❌ "Join our amazing community..."  
✅ "1,247 developers shipping daily. 23 agents deployed this week. Your turn: discord.gg/cere"

## The Three Tests

Before publishing anything, ask:

### 1. The Developer Test
*"Does this make me want to build something RIGHT NOW?"*

If not, add code examples or reduce time-to-deploy.

### 2. The Token Holder Test  
*"Does this show why tokens gain value?"*

If not, add metrics showing network usage = demand.

### 3. The Fred Test
*"Would Fred say 'ship it' or 'what the fuck is this?'"*

If the latter, start over. With violence.

## Emergency Responses

### For FUD
1. Acknowledge quickly
2. Respond with data
3. Show live dashboards
4. Move on

**Template**: "Fair question. Here's the data: [link]. Judge for yourself."

### For Bugs/Downtime
1. Own it immediately
2. ETA to resolution
3. Regular updates
4. Post-mortem with fixes
5. Turn into strength

**Template**: "Node 41 down. Team on it. ETA: 30 min. Status: status.cere.network"

### For Success
1. Screenshot everything
2. Share everywhere  
3. Tag the builder
4. Show the code
5. Inspire copycats

**Template**: "🚀 @builder just [achievement]. See how: [link]. Who's next?"

## Quality Checklist

Before hitting publish:

- [ ] Is there proof? (link, metric, or screenshot)
- [ ] Is the CTA clear? (one action, not five)
- [ ] Would a developer understand in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Does it show value creation or capture?
- [ ] Is it true TODAY? (not promises)
- [ ] Would you bet your reputation on it?

---

## The Prime Directive

**Every piece of content is a weapon. It either recruits a builder or creates a holder. There is no third option.**

Write like the competition is gaining on us. Because they are.

Write like every word costs $1000. Because developer attention does.

Write like Fred is reading over your shoulder. Because he probably is.

Ship content that ships code.

*"The best writing is code that works. The second best is words that make people write code. Everything else is noise." - Fred*
