# 🚀 Cere Network $100K Agent Bounty Program

**Build the Future. Own the Rewards.**

---

## The Mission

We're not here to build another blockchain. We're here to replace the cloud with something you actually own. 

To accelerate this mission, we're putting $100,000 on the table for developers who build production-ready AI agents on the Cere Stack.

No hackathon. No demo day. Just build something people use, and get paid.

## The Bottom Line

We're not running another corporate hackathon where you build demos that die after judging.

We want production agents. Real users. Actual revenue. Permanent infrastructure.

The cloud giants built their empires by capturing developer mindshare. We're taking it back, one agent at a time.

**$100,000 is just the beginning. The real prize is owning the future.**
